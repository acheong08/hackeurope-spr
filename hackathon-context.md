# Security Track

Prize: €1,000

## Bluedot Impact & Track Context

BlueDot
Impact builds courses and communities to train the next generation of
AI safety professionals and are pioneers of def/acc (Defensive
Acceleration) philosophy: the best solution to technological risk is
accelerating defensive technologies to outpace offensive capabilities.
The relevance today could not be clearer, as even a college student with
AI access can now explore dangerous cyberattack strategies, yet our
defensive infrastructure from surveillance to cybersecurity remains
outdated and fragmented.

Track Goal: Build a security tool that detects, monitors, or mitigates AI-enabled threats before they scale.

## Project Directions

You are free to build in any security domain so long as the project strengthens the defender rather than the attacker!

## Case Studies & Inspiration
